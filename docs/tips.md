# Tips

## Editing

The best free text editor available at the moment is probably [Atom](https://atom.io/), but there are a lot of options. Recommended Atom addons:

- [Autoprefixer](https://atom.io/packages/autoprefixer)
- [Color Picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker)
- [Autocomplete +](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-plus)

## Where to learn

### Reference

The best resource for learning about individual features of CSS, JS, and HTML is [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). When Googling, prepend mdn to your query to get good results (example: [mdn position fixed](https://www.google.com/?q=mdn%20position%20fixed#q=mdn+position+fixed)).

For learning about any of the included libraries, look at their doc sites for best results.

Another excellent tool for quick reference is [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash), which can be integrated into your text editor to help you quickly look up specific aspects of code.
